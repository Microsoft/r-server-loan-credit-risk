This guide assumes you are using an on premises  SQL Server for this solution.  

*If you have deployed the {{ site.solution_name}} solution from the [Cortana Intelligence Gallery]({{ site.aka_url }}) you should instead [use this guide](CIG_Workflow.html).*


To demonstrate a typical workflow, we'll introduce you to a few personas.  You can follow along by performing the same steps for each persona.  

NOTE: If youâ€™re just interested in the outcomes of this process we have also created a fully automated solution that simulates the data, trains and scores the models by executing PowerShell scripts. This is the fastest way to deploy the solution on your machine. See [PowerShell Instructions](Powershell_Instructions.html) for this deployment.

If you want to follow along and have *not* run the PowerShell script, you will need to first create a database table in your SQL Server.  You will then need to replace the connection_string at the top of each R file with your database and login information.

     {% include step1.md %} 
     
You can perform these steps in your environment by using the instructions in <a href="START_HERE.html">START HERE</a>.

## Step 2: Data Prep and Modeling with Debra the Data Scientist
-----------------------------------------------------------------

{% include dsintro.md %}

Debra will work on her own machine, using  [R Client](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/install-r-client-windows) to execute these R scripts. She will need to [install and configure an R IDE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/r-client-get-started#configure-ide) to use with R Client.

Now that Debra's environment is set up, she  opens her IDE and creates a Project.  To follow along with her, open the **{{ site.folder_name }}/R** directory.  There you will see three files with the name `{{ site.solution_name }}`.

* If you use Visual Studio, double click on the Visual Studio SLN file.
* If you use RStudio, double click on the "R Project" file.

 <a name="step3" id="step3"></a>

   {% include step3.md %}


You can find this script in the **SQLR** directory, and execute it yourself by following the [PowerShell Instructions](Powershell_Instructions.html).   As noted earlier, this is the fastest way to execute all the code included in this solution.  (This will re-create the same set of tables and models as the above R scripts.)
