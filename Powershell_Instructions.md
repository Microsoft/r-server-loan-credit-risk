If you are configuring your own server, continue with the steps below to run the PowerShell script.

## Setup
-----------

First, make sure you have <a href="SetupSQL.html">set up your SQL Server</a>.  Then proceed with the steps below to run the solution template using the automated PowerShell files. 

## Execute PowerShell Script
----------------------------

Running this PowerShell script will create stored procedures for the the operationalization of this solution.  It will also execute these procedures to create full database with results of the steps  – dataset creation, modeling, and scoring as described in the [For the Database Analyst](dba.html) page.



1.	Click on the windows key on your keyboard. Type the words `PowerShell`.  Right click on Windows Powershell to and select `Run as administrator` to open the PowerShell window.


2.	In the Powershell command window, type the following command:
  
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```

    Answer `y` to the prompt to allow the following scripts to execute.

3. Create a directory on your computer where you will put this solution.  CD to the directory and then clone the repository into it:
    
    ```
    git clone {{ site.code_url }} {{ site.folder_name }}
    ```

4.  Now CD to the **{{ site.folder_name }}/SQLR** directory and run one of the two following commands, inserting your server name, database name, username, and password.

     * Run with no prompts: 
    
        ```
        .\{{ site.ps1_name }} -ServerName "Server Name" -DBName "Database Name" -username "" -password "" -is_production "N" -uninterrupted "Y"  
        ```
        
    * Run with prompts:

        ```
        .\{{ site.ps1_name }} -ServerName "Server Name" -DBName "Database Name" -username "" -password "" -is_production "N" -uninterrupted "N"  
        ```

    * For example, uninterrupted mode for the <code>rdemo</code> user created by the <strong>create_user.sql</strong> script on your local machine, the command would be: 

        ```
        .\{{ site.ps1_name }} -ServerName "localhost" -DBName "{{ site.db_name }}" -username "rdemo" -password "D@tascience" -is_production "N" -uninterrupted "Y"  
        ```

5.  If running uninterrupted (`-uninterrupted "Y"`), default names are used.

6.  If running with prompts (`-uninterrupted "N"`), you cannot complete a step until the previous step has been completed, so only skip steps that have previously been executed.  Running in this mode allows you to specify non default names for tables.

7.  You can also optionally add the parameter -dataPath "your path\to\csv files".  If you omit this, it defaults to the Data folder in the current directory.

<h2 id="score-production-data">Score Production Data</h2>
<hr />
<p/>
To score production data re-run the command from above, this time using `-is_production "Y"`.  You can also score production data in a different database by changing -DBName.  If you do use a different database, also add `-development_db`.  For example, the following will score into database `Loans_Prod` in uninterrupted mode for the rdemo user on your local machine:

        
        .\{{ site.ps1_name }} -ServerName "localhost" -DBName "{{ site.db_name }}_Prod" -username "rdemo" -password "D@tascience" -is_production "Y" -uninterrupted "Y" -development_db "{{ site.db_name }}"


## Review Data
--------------

Once the PowerShell script has completed successfully, log into the SQL Server Management Studio to view all the datasets that have been created in the `{{ site.db_name }}` and the `{{ site.db_name }}_Prod` databases.  
Hit `Refresh` if necessary.
<br/>

* View [more information](tables.html)  about each of these tables.

* Right click on `{{ site.db_name }}.dbo.Scores` and select `View Top 1000 Rows` to preview the testing scored data.

* Right click on `{{ site.db_name }}_Prod.dbo.Prod_Scores` and select `View Top 1000 Rows` to preview the production scored data.


## Visualizing Results 
---------------------

You've now  uploaded and processed borrower and loan data, created models, evaluated the model and scored new data as described  [here](data-scientist.html). 

Let's look at our current results. Proceed to <a href="Visualize_Results.html">Visualizing Results with PowerBI</a>.

## Other Steps
----------------

You've just completed the fully automated solution by executing PowerShell scripts.  

See the [Typical Workflow](Typical.html) for a description of how these files were first created in R by a Data Scientist and then incorporated into the SQL stored procedures that you just deployed.
