XXXINTRO 

For customers who prefer an on-premise solution, the implementation with SQL Server R Services is a great option that takes advantage of the powerful combination of SQL Server and the R language. We have modeled the steps in the template after a realistic team collaboration on a data science process. Data scientists do the data preparation, model training, and evaluation from their favorite R IDE. DBAs can take care of the deployment using SQL stored procedures with embedded R code. Power BI is also available for analysts to visualize the deployed results. We also show how each of these steps can be executed on a SQL Server client environment such as SQL Server Management Studio. A Windows PowerShell script that invokes the SQL scripts that execute the end-to-end modeling process is provided for convenience.
